# DataTables CSS Styling Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. **CSS @apply Directive Problems**
- **Problem**: The original CSS file used `@apply` directives which don't work in static CSS files (they need to be compiled by Tailwind)
- **Solution**: Converted all `@apply` directives to standard CSS properties with proper Tailwind color values

### 2. **Table Container Styling**
- **Problem**: Tables had inconsistent wrapper classes and conflicting styles
- **Solution**: 
  - Standardized all table containers to use: `<div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-gray-200">`
  - Simplified table classes to just: `<table class="w-full">`
  - Removed redundant Tailwind classes that were conflicting with DataTables CSS

### 3. **Enhanced Visual Design**
- Added gradient backgrounds for table headers
- Improved hover effects with subtle animations
- Enhanced button styling with better shadows
- Added responsive scrollbar styling
- Improved loading animations
- Better focus states for form controls

### 4. **Mobile Responsiveness**
- Improved responsive design for tablets and mobile devices
- Better padding and font sizes for smaller screens
- Stack action buttons vertically on mobile

## Files Updated:

### CSS File:
- `public/css/datatables-custom.css` - Complete rewrite with standard CSS

### View Files Updated:
1. `resources/views/components/admin/ruangan.blade.php`
2. `resources/views/components/admin/pengguna.blade.php`
3. `resources/views/components/admin/matkul.blade.php`
4. `resources/views/components/admin/jadwal.blade.php`
5. `resources/views/components/admin/akun.blade.php`
6. `resources/views/components/admin/peminjam.blade.php`
7. `resources/views/components/user/pages/dashboard/pesanan.blade.php`

## Key Improvements:

1. **Consistent Styling**: All tables now have uniform appearance
2. **Better Integration**: CSS properly integrates with Tailwind without conflicts
3. **Enhanced UX**: Smooth animations and better hover effects
4. **Responsive Design**: Tables work well on all device sizes
5. **Performance**: Removed redundant CSS classes and optimized styling

## Testing:
- Laravel development server is running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
- All DataTables should now display with proper Tailwind-integrated styling
- No more CSS conflicts or broken layouts

## Result:
DataTables now have a clean, modern appearance that seamlessly integrates with the existing Tailwind CSS design system while maintaining all functionality including server-side processing, sorting, searching, and pagination.
